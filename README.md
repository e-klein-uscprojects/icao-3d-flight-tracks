# ICAO 3D Flight Tracks Visualization

I am an aeronautical analyst with a background in aviation operations, procedural development, and spatial data strategy. This repository represents the first phase of a technical initiative I’ve long envisioned—namely, the interactive rendering of ICAO instrument procedures using structured metadata and geospatial analysis in three dimensions.

Over the past several months, I’ve studied the procedural architecture embedded in Host graphics, Supplements, and FLIP publications. What emerged was an opportunity not only to visualize approach paths, missed tracks, and holding patterns, but to encode procedural nuance—lighting systems, design criteria, required equipment notes—into a dynamic, user-accessible platform.

The goal of this interface is not simply visualization. It is compliance, traceability, and insight. This project is designed to incorporate:

- Aircraft track modeling (final + missed segments)
- ICAO metadata extraction: procedure titles, coordinates, primary NAVAIDs
- Visualization of ADIZ, SUAS, and international boundaries
- Structured support for PBN, CPDLC, RADAR minima, and communication frequencies

The repo is scaffolded with folders dedicated to procedural ingestion, metadata parsing, and rendering through CesiumJS. If successful, I expect this model will be scalable to other regions and procedures, with potential applications in regulatory analysis and pilot briefings.

Thank you for reviewing the materials. I welcome technical feedback and collaboration as the system evolves.
